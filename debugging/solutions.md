 1. A `break` statement before line 66
 2. A bad property name. It is not `direction` but `orientation` in the _Switch statements_.
 3. A memory sharing problem in `moveForward()` method.
 4. Tests are wrong and but the lack of error detection makes difficult to catch the problem.
 5. `'use strict'` is not present and the `i` variable being used in `move()` and `thereIsObstacle()` is the same **global**.
